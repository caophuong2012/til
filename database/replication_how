How replication work?
Master:
- Write replication events to binary log.
- Whenever a slave connects to master, master creates a new thread for the
  connection
Client:
Two threads are started:
- IO thread: connect to master, read binary logs from the master as they come
  in and just copies them to local log file called relay log.
  Note Master_Log_File and Read_Master_Log_Pos
- SQL thread: read from relay log and apply them ASAP
