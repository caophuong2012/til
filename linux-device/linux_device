Loop device is pseudo-device that makes a file accessible as a block device. A
loop device must be connected to existing file in the filesystem. This device
are often used for CD.

Pseudo-device: Device nodes in Unix-like systems do not neccessarily have to
correspond to physical devices:
- /dev/null: accepts and discards all ouputs
- /dev/random: produce variable-length stream of pseudo-random numbers.
